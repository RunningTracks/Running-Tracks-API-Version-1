Our metaverse land parcels have been confirmed. Inline with our original white paper, we intend to map our `hardware` component to `71.6456050,-28.6577627` as the starting position which enables streamlined access to platforms that require coordinates to be added. The map can be explored with the coordinates at [https://map.runningtracks.net/](https://map.runningtracks.net/).
