# The Eco-system Prize Pool
Running Tracks will distrbute 100,000,000 `RNTR` tokens from the 1,000,000,000 minted to the community over a period of 15 years. These funds are primarily used to stimulate play 2 earn.

All tokens will be distrubuted over the course of the day by a company with a split applied (subject to change). 

- Daily Contests Distrubution
  - Split over several contests
- Land Owner Hosting Reward
- Inventory drops.

The manner in which this is split is subject to change based on the companies on-going feedback. However, the daily prize pool will not change downwards. In the event that not all tokens have been distrubuted in a 24 hour period, then that amount will rollover to the next day.

## Free-to-play
Anyone can enter Running Tracks, earn `fuel` and then redeem that `fuel` for a place in a daily contests.

## Prize Pool Runtime
The prize pool runtime will run from 1st March 2022 until 1st March 2036. This allows for 5,479 days of distrubution of tokens. This eqautes to roughly 18,251 RNTR tokens that will be distrubuted daily in contests and to land owners.

## Portion reserved for inventory `rntr` token drops
A unspecified amount of tokens will be dropped each day as part of the `inventory drops` that take place. Inventory drops exist to provide such items as `apples`, `oranges` and `mushrooms` (see full list of [available inventory](./rest-api.md#available-items)) to active users to discover on their journey.

## Land owners rewards for hosting
Land owners will receive `hosting rewards` should their land be selected to host a daily contest. There are a number of factors based around how selection for hosting an event works.

## How rollovers work
Rollovers happen in the event that some tokens remain from the previous day. Events such as potential outages, or technical errors around drops can possibly occur. In this event the tokens not distrubuted on that day will be rolled to the next 24 hour period.

## Current Status
The current status of this propsoal is in the last stage of approval and is subject to change.
