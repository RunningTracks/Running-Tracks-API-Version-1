# Avatar Control
There are two primary types of avatar control in which are available in Running Tracks. The primary, which is health centric, is concentrated on `hardware`, followed by `controller (also referred to as `h` and `c`).

## Hardware based health
Running Tracks heavily leans towards allowing a user to be active while they play, we endorse and want to push users into the direction of connecting run tracker hardware so a user can participate while on their treadmill.

We also are very aware that with the requirements for hardware solely, this will remove a lot of players from the potential pool of users who may be interested in playing on Running Tracks. This is why we have introduced a `controller` type, where a user can still play and be seperated out from those `hardware` players.

## Who can I see?
You can specify, if you want to see just `hardware`, `controller` or both. You have options to customize your experience. The controller aspect of Running Tracks is more based around the forward motion of a user, and collecting `inventory` and exploring without having to spend time on your treadmill.

## Seperate Profiles
Every user will have two types of account summary, `hardware` and `controller`. The result of this seperation means that users can keep there real life efforts in the metaverse seperate from a handheld play.

## Controller promotion of a healthier lifestyle
With the controller being the easiest way for a user to get involved, this gives us a great opportunity to upsell the use of hardware for a better reward structure in game, and in your diet.
